# Token Television
The Token Television repository includes all the code that is necessary in the first phase of the Token Television launch. 

In particular, it includes the Token Television smart contract. It allows a user to subscribe to the platform (paying with ETH), storing the Digital Right Management (DRM) in the Ethereum blockchain.

To start, check the smartContract directory and its README.
